WHAT IT FINDS:
    vid_dup_finder finds near-duplicate video files on disk. It detects videos whose
    frames look similar, and where the videos are roughly the same length (within
    ~5%). 

    vid_dup_finder will work with most common video file formats (any format 
    supported by FFMPEG.)

LIMITATIONS:
    vid_dup_finder will find duplicates if minor changes have been made to the 
    video, such as resizing, small colour corrections, small crops or faint 
    watermarks. It will not find duplicates if there are larger changes (flipping or
    rotation, embedding in a corner of a different video etc)

    To save processing time when working on large datasets, vid_dup_finder uses only
    frames from the first 30 seconds of any video. vid_dup_finder may return false
    positives when used on content of the same length and and a common first-30-
    seconds (for example a series of cartoons with a fixed into sequence)

PREREQUISITES:
    Ffmpeg must be available on the command line. You can do this by:
    * Debian-based systems: # apt install ffmpeg
    * Yum-based systems:    # yum install ffmpeg
    * Windows:
        1) Download the correct installer from <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>
        2) Run the installer and install ffmpeg to any directory
        3) Add the directory into the PATH environment variable

EXAMPLES:
    To find all duplicate videos in directory "dog_vids":
    * vid_dup_finder --files dog_vids

    To find all videos which are not duplicates in "dog_vids":
    * vid_dup_finder --files dog_vids --search-unique

    To find videos in "dog_vids" that have accidentally been replicated into "cat_vids"
    * vid_dup_finder --files cat_vids --with-refs dog_vids

    To exclude a file or directory from a search, e.g "dog_vids/beagles"
    * vid_dup_finder --files dog_vids --exclude dog_vids/beagles
